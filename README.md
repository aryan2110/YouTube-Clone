## üí° Purpose

The goal of this project was to:
- Practice HTML structure and semantic tags
- Learn modern CSS styling and layout techniques (especially Flexbox)
- Understand how real-world UI components are built

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project was built by following along with [SuperSimpleDev‚Äôs HTML/CSS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc). While the layout and concept are based on the tutorial, I made several changes in the code structure and class naming as part of my own learning.
